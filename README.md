# SymptomSaga â€“ Heart Palpitation Tracking App

**SymptomSaga** is an iOS app built in **Swift** using the **[Spezi framework](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi)**.  
The app helps patients capture and contextualize **episodic heart palpitations** by combining:  
- **ECG and health data** from wearables (via Apple HealthKit)  
- **Symptom reporting** through a guided questionnaire  
- **Secure, shareable health reports** for clinicians  

This project was developed as part of the course [TRA460: Digital Health Implementation](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/course-selection-and-registration/select-courses/choose-a-tracks-course/digital-health-implementation/) at Chalmers University of Technology.

## Features

- **Health Data Integration**  
  - Fetches ECG, heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability from **Apple HealthKit**  
  - Supports real-time visualization of wearable data  

- **Symptom Tracking**  
  - Patients log palpitations, severity, duration, and potential triggers  
  - Data is timestamped and linked with corresponding health metrics  

- **FHIR Backend Support**  
  - All health data and symptom logs are converted into **FHIR resources**  
  - Data can be pushed to a **FHIR server** (HAPI FHIR or Meld Sandbox)  

- **Shareable Reports**  
  - Patients can generate a secure, time-limited web link to share compiled health reports  
  - Reports include vitals, ECG traces, and symptom insights  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  - Simple onboarding process with consent handling  
  - Dashboard showing most recent vitals and past logs  
  - Settings for digital prescriptions via external apps (e.g., Fibricheck integration)
